Crypto ArbitrageÂ¶
This is a GW bootcamp Challenge where I was asked to considering arbitrage opportunities in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoin trades on markets across the globe, can you capitalize on simultaneous price dislocations in those markets by using the powers of Pandas?

I was asked to sort through historical trade data for Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase. I was asked  to apply the three phases of financial analysis to determine if any arbitrage opportunities exist for Bitcoin.

The Challenge had  3 phases.

1. Collect the data.

2. Prepare the data.

3. Analyze the data.


#Technologies
The code is written in Python 3.7. I used Jupyter Lab, and used pathlib, pandas, numpy, and mathplotlib 

#Installation Guide

import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path
%matplotlib inline
import numpy as np

#USAGE

Calculate the Arbitrage Profits

The potentail profit per trade is $776.13
